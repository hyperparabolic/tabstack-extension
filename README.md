#Tabstack browser extension

Temporary tab storage, somewhere between the top bar and bookmarks.

WIP.  This doesn't do much yet, basically just a project skeleton at the moment.

This will probably be a personal use workflow extension relatively soon, for the purpose of learning more about front end development and browser extension development.  Currently only firefox is supported.

## TODO:

- finish supported actions
- persist stack to disk
- sync stack to sync storage
- styles
- testing
